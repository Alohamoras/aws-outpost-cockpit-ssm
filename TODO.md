# Project Roadmap & To-Do List

## ðŸ”§ Critical Fixes & Testing

### Storage Configuration Issues
- [ ] **Validate storage configuration script** - Test RAID5 setup with three unused drives and root OS extension
- [ ] **Add storage validation tests** - Create test scripts to verify RAID configurations work correctly
- [ ] **Document storage prerequisites** - Specify minimum drive requirements and supported configurations (optional?)

### Core Infrastructure
- [X] **Add Local Network Interface (LNI) provisioning** - Automatically create and configure LNI during instance launch
- [ ] **Configure LNI as default VM interface** - Ensure hosted VMs use LNI instead of ENI for Outpost-local traffic

- [ ] **Infrastructure as Code integration** - CloudFormation/CDK templates for complete stack deployment
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline integration** - GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and deployment

### Operational Excellence
- [ ] **Support model definition** - Document support expectations, escalation paths, and maintenance windows
- [ ] **Automated patching workflows** - Scripts for coordinated OS and application updates across clusters
- [ ] **Configuration drift detection** - Tools to ensure deployed instances match expected configuration
- [ ] **Cost optimization tools** - Scripts for right-sizing instances and optimizing resource utilization

## ðŸ”„ Automation & Lifecycle Management

### Image & Template Management
- [ ] **AMI pipeline development** - Automated AMI creation with pre-installed Cockpit and configurations
- [ ] **Golden image maintenance** - Automated testing and updating of base images
- [ ] **Template versioning** - Semantic versioning for VM templates and infrastructure configurations
- [ ] **Compliance scanning** - Automated security and compliance validation for images

### Operational Workflows
- [ ] **Blue/green deployment patterns** - Safe deployment strategies for production updates
- [ ] **Canary deployment support** - Gradual rollout mechanisms for infrastructure changes
- [ ] **Automated rollback procedures** - Quick recovery mechanisms for failed deployments
- [ ] **Health check automation** - Comprehensive monitoring and auto-remediation capabilities

## ðŸ“Š Quality & Testing

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Integration test suite** - End-to-end testing of full deployment scenarios
- [ ] **Performance test suite** - Load testing for various workload scenarios  
- [ ] **Chaos engineering tests** - Fault injection and resilience validation
- [ ] **Security penetration testing** - Regular security validation and hardening verification

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Static code analysis** - shellcheck, hadolint, and other linting tools
- [ ] **Dependency vulnerability scanning** - Regular security scanning of all dependencies
- [ ] **Code coverage metrics** - Establish baseline test coverage requirements
- [ ] **Documentation coverage** - Ensure all features have comprehensive documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Considerations

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **GPU workload support** - Configuration for AI/ML workloads on GPU-enabled instances
- [ ] **Container orchestration** - Integration with Kubernetes or OpenShift on Outpost
- [ ] **Edge computing patterns** - Optimizations for edge deployments and low-latency workloads
- [ ] **Multi-region disaster recovery** - Cross-region backup and failover strategies

### Platform Integration
- [ ] **AWS native service integration** - Direct integration with RDS, EFS, and other AWS services
- [ ] **Third-party tool ecosystem** - Integration with Terraform, Ansible, Helm, and other DevOps tools
- [ ] **Marketplace distribution** - Potential AWS Marketplace listing for broader adoption
- [ ] **Partner ecosystem development** - Integration patterns for ISV and consulting partner solutions

## Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
- Storage configuration validation and fixes - root volume still not working
- Project background documentation
- Production architecture guide
- troubleshoot why application and VM service isn't installed by default
- Check for hard coded variables like region az etc.

### Medium Priority (Next Quarter)
- Migration workflows
- Cluster storage implementation
- AMI pipeline development
- Comprehensive testing suite

### Low Priority (Future Releases)
- Advanced networking features
- Partner ecosystem development
