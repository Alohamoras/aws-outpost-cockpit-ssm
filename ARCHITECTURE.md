# Architecture Guide

Technical deep-dive into the AWS Outpost Cockpit SSM deployment architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è SSM Multi-Phase Architecture

The deployment uses AWS Systems Manager for reliable, observable deployment across 7 phases:

### Phase 1: Minimal User-Data Bootstrap
- **File**: `user-data-minimal.sh` (~40 lines vs 378 in legacy)
- **Purpose**: Network readiness validation and SSM agent setup
- **Duration**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Critical**: Must complete successfully for SSM phases to work

### Phase 2-7: SSM Document Execution
Executed sequentially by the launcher via AWS Systems Manager:

#### Phase 2: System Updates (`outpost-system-updates.json`)
- System package updates and AWS CLI verification
- Duration: ~10-15 minutes

#### Phase 3: Storage Configuration (`outpost-storage-config.json`)
- RAID5 setup for data drives (3+ drives required)
- Root OS volume extension using available space
- LVM volume creation for VMs, containers, and storage
- Duration: ~5-15 minutes
- Non-critical: Deployment continues if this fails

#### Phase 4: Core Cockpit (`outpost-cockpit-core.json`)
- Core Cockpit packages and basic configuration
- Duration: ~5-10 minutes

#### Phase 5: Cockpit Extensions (`outpost-cockpit-extensions.json`)
- Virtualization, containers, and monitoring packages
- Duration: ~15-20 minutes
- Non-critical: Deployment continues if this fails

#### Phase 6: Third-party Extensions (`outpost-cockpit-thirdparty.json`)
- 45Drives extensions for enhanced functionality
- Duration: ~5-10 minutes
- Non-critical: Deployment continues if this fails

#### Phase 7: Final Configuration (`outpost-cockpit-config.json`)
- User accounts, final settings, and verification
- Duration: ~2-5 minutes

### Cockpit Components Installed
- **Core**: cockpit, cockpit-system, cockpit-ws, cockpit-bridge
- **Network & Storage**: cockpit-networkmanager, cockpit-storaged
- **Package Management**: cockpit-packagekit, cockpit-sosreport
- **Virtualization**: cockpit-machines, qemu-kvm, libvirt, virt-install
- **Containers**: cockpit-podman, podman, buildah, skopeo
- **Monitoring**: cockpit-pcp, pcp, pcp-system-tools
- **Third-party Extensions**: cockpit-file-sharing, cockpit-navigator, cockpit-identities, cockpit-sensors (from 45Drives repo)

### Testing and Validation
- **Primary Monitoring**: Console log output parsed for completion markers ("COMPLETE COCKPIT DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS")
- **Error Detection**: Console logs monitored for failure patterns ("Bootstrap.*failed", "ERROR.*failed")
- **Web Interface Test**: Optional curl test to port 9090 (non-blocking)
- **Network Readiness**: Validated against multiple endpoints (Rocky repo, AWS S3)
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time console output display during bootstrap

## State Management

### Instance State Tracking
- Instance details are stored in `.last-instance-id` after launch
- Contains instance ID, public IP, and bootstrap status for management operations

### Phase State Detection
The smart launcher can detect which phases have completed by:
- Checking SSM command history via AWS API
- Analyzing console log markers for completion status
- Validating service states and file markers on the instance

### Resume Logic
When resuming a deployment:
1. **State Analysis**: Checks AWS SSM command history for the instance
2. **Phase Detection**: Determines the last successfully completed phase
3. **Validation**: Verifies phase completion through multiple methods
4. **Smart Resume**: Continues from the next required phase
5. **Error Handling**: Can retry failed phases or skip non-critical ones

## File Structure Details

```
ssm-documents/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outpost-system-updates.json      # Phase 2: System updates and AWS CLI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outpost-storage-config.json      # Phase 3: RAID5 and storage optimization

Each SSM document is a self-contained deployment phase with:
- **Input validation** for required parameters
- **Idempotent operations** that can be safely re-run
- **Comprehensive logging** to phase-specific log files
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Success markers** for state tracking
